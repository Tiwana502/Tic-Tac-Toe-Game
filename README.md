# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Hi, I'm a moderately young, creative, and up & coming full stack Web Developer in the making. My name is Tiwana Jones. I decided to use the Iconic Malcolm X and Oprah Winfrey as the player one and player two in my rendition of the Tic Tac Toe game because of the obvious X and O in their name. I always wanted to know how a conversation between the two would go. Although I respect and admire both greatly, I never agreed with either fully. I have a dual nature as a Gemini in the zodiac , therefore, let the games begin.

User stories
- The user of this Tic-Tac-Toe game rendition will enjoy the ability to play as one of two cultural icons; either Malcolm X or Oprah Winfrey.
- The user that plays as Malcolm X knows that X marks the spot in order to win.
- The user that plays as Oprah will counter or challege  Malcolm's hypothesis with an "Oh, Really?!", for the the win.
-  The Oprah player adheres to the Beyonce' philosophy , believing that women run the world ,and as that user, "Oh what a feeling world domination brings!"
-  The Malcolm X users believe in the Xpanse/expanse of patriarchy, planting their X flag every where the user may strategicly choose to go.

The technologies I implemented to bring my version of the game to fruition were a Wireframe, css file, Html file and Javascript file.
